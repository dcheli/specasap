This is a permanent identifier for an order and its associated observations. It is a special case of the Entity Identifier data type (see Chapter 2, section 2.A.28, 'EI – entity identifier'). The first component is a string that identifies an individual order segment (i.e., ORC segment and associated order detail segment). It is assigned by the order filling (receiving) application. It identifies an order uniquely among all orders from a particular filling application (e.g., clinical laboratory). This uniqueness must persist over time.  The second through fourth components contain the filler application ID, in the form of the HD data type (see section 2.A.36, 'HD – hierarchic designator'). The second component is a user-defined coded value that uniquely defines the application from other applications on the network. A limit of six (6) characters is suggested but not required. The second component of the filler order number always identifies the actual filler of an order.  See ORC-3-filler order number for information on when this field must be valued. The conditions which make this field required are divided into two main issues. The data in ORC-2 and OBR-2 are logically the same thing: a placer id. The data in ORC-3 and OBR-3 are logically the same thing: the filler id.  From that perspective, each message must have either a placer or a filler id with an exception for the case of a 'Send Number' control code since its purpose is to request a placer id. If both ORC and OBR are present in a message, then only one of the Segments must contain the value(s). If both segments contain either ORC-2/OBR-2 or ORC-3/OBR-3, then each pair must be a matching pair. The sending system can include both the filler and the placer number in both the ORC and OBR segments as long as the data is the same between the two segments. It is recommended that the initiating system should provide a unique number when a new order or unsolicited result is initially communicated. The filler order number (OBR-3 or ORC-3) also uniquely identifies an order and its associated observations. For example, suppose that an institution collects observations from several ancillary applications into a common database and this common database is queried by yet another application for observations. In this case, the filler order number and placer order number transmitted by the common database application would be that of the original filler and placer, respectively, rather than a new one assigned by the common database application. Similarly, if a third-party application, not the filler or placer, of an order were authorized to modify the status of an order (say, cancel it), the third-party application would send the filler an ORM message containing an ORC segment with ORC-1-order control equal to 'CA' and containing the original placer order number and filler order number, rather than assign either itself."}]}

For example, a chest X-ray report might include three separate diagnostic impressions. The standard requires three OBX segments, one for each impression. By putting a 1 in the Sub-ID of the first of these OBX segments, 2 in the second, and 3 in the third, we can uniquely identify each OBX segment for editing or replacement.

OBX-2-value type contains the data type for this field according to which observation value is formatted. It is not a required field because some systems will report only the Interpretation Codes (OBX-8), especially in product experience reporting. The length of the observation field is variable, depending upon OBX-2-value type. This field may repeat for multipart, single answer results.  Representation This field contains the value related to the OBX-3-observation identifier of the same segment. Depending upon the observation, the data type may be a number (e.g., a respiratory rate), a coded answer (e.g., a pathology impression recorded as SNOMED), or a date/time (the date/time that a unit of blood is sent to the ward). An observation value is always represented as the data type specified in OBX-2-value type of the same segment. Whether numeric or short text, the answer shall be recorded in ASCII text. Reporting logically independent observations The main sections of dictated reports, such as radiologic studies or history and physicals, are reported as separate OBX segments. In addition, each logically independent observation should be reported in a separate OBX segment, i.e., one OBX segment should not contain the result of more than one logically independent observation, unless it is part of a list of like concepts that belong together (e.g., a list of conditions tested for in newborn screening or mutations looked for in genomic testing). This requirement is included to assure that the contents of OBX-6-units, OBX-8-interpretation codes, and OBX-9-probability can be interpreted unambiguously. This means that all other OBX field values apply equally to the whole of OBX-5 noting that OBX-6 does not apply in the case of coded values. The electrolytes and vital signs batteries, for example, would each be reported as four separate OBX segments. Two diagnostic impressions, e.g., congestive heart failure and pneumonia, would also be reported as two separate OBX segments whether reported as part of a discharge summary or chest X-ray report. Similarly, two bacterial organisms isolated in a single bacterial culture would be reported as two separate OBX segments. Though two independent diagnostic statements cannot be reported in one OBX segment, unless they represent elements of a single list to which all other OBX field values apply equally, multiple categorical responses are allowed (usually as CWE data types separated by repeat delimiters), so long as they are fragments (modifiers) that together construct one diagnostic statement. Right upper lobe (recorded as one code) and pneumonia (recorded as another code), for example, could be both reported in one OBX segment. Such multiple 'values' would be separated by repeat delimiters. The other example where use of repeat delimiters is allowed for coded values would be a list of conditions or mutations tested for to provide reference for the test results reported in related, but independent OBX segments. Multiple answers to a single question (for example mark all that apply type questions) could also be handled using this approach. It is important to state that ANY independent observation, that may require parent-child linking to additional tests, such as reflex testing, SHALL NOT be included in a single OBX-5 field using repeat delimiters, nor any list elements that require variations in the values of other OBX field values. The following provides an example of how this may be communicated for 10 Cystic Fibrosis mutations, where the mutations are highlighted in red font (note that some labs test for as many as 140 mutations): OBX|1|CWE|21656-4^CFTR gene mutations tested for in Blood or Tissue by Molecular genetics method Nominal  ^LN|1|c.254G>A^^HGVS~c.350G>A^^HGVS~c.489+1G>T^^HGVS~c.579+1G>T^^HGVS~c.1000C>T^^HGVS~c.1040G>C^^HGVS~c.1364C>A^^HGVS~c.1519_1521del^^HGVS~c.1521_1523del^^HGVS~c.1585-1G>A^^HGVS|||N|||F  Multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and Sub ID  In some systems, a single observation may include fragments of more than one data type. The most common example is a numeric result followed by coded comments (CWE). In this case, the logical observation can be sent in more than one OBX segment. For example, one segment of numeric data type for the numeric result and another segment of CWE data type for coded comments. If the producer was reporting multiple coded comments they would all be sent in one OBX segment separated by repeat delimiters because they all modified a single logical observation. Multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID should always be sent in sequence with the most significant OBX segment (the one that has the normal flag/units and or reference range and status flag) first. The value of OBX-6 through 12 should be null in any following OBX segments with the same OBX-3-observation identifier and OBX-4-observation sub-ID. For the purpose of replacement or deletion, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and sub ID are treated as a unit. If any are replaced or deleted, they all are replaced. Coded values   When an OBX segment contains values of CWE data types, the observations are stored as a combination of codes and/or text. In Section 7.8.3, 'CSS - Clinical Study Data Schedule Segment,' examples of results that are represented as CWE data types are shown in the first and second OBX segments of OBR 1 and the first and second OBX segments of OBR 2. The observation may be an observation battery ID (for recommended studies), a diagnostic code or finding (for a diagnostic impression), or an anatomic site for a pathology report, or any of the other kinds of coded results."}]}

Results may also be reported in shorthand by reporting the normalcy status without specifying the exact numeric value of the result. Such shorthand is quite common in clinical notes, where physicians will simply say that the glucose result was normal. Such shorthand reporting is also seen in drug experience reporting.

Refer to HL7 table 0085 - Observation result status codes interpretation for valid values. This field reflects the current completion status of the results for one Observation Identifier.  It is a required field. Previous versions of HL7 stated this implicitly by defining a default value of 'F.' Code F indicates that the result has been verified to be correct and final. Code W indicates that the result has been verified to be wrong (incorrect); a replacement (corrected) result may be transmitted later. Code C indicates that data contained in the OBX-5-observation value field are to replace previously transmitted (verified and) final result data with the same observation ID (including suffix, if applicable) and observation sub-ID usually because the previous results were wrong. Code D indicates that data previously transmitted in a result segment with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID should be deleted. When changing or deleting a result, multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID and observation sub-ID are replaced or deleted as a unit. Normal progression of results through intermediate (e.g., 'gram positive cocci') to final (e.g., 'staphylococcus aureus') should not be transmitted as C (correction); they should be transmitted as P (depending upon the specific case) until they are final. If an observation involves multiple OBX segments with the same observation ID (including suffix) and observation sub-ID, the observation result status applies to all OBX segments, except where the value is D or X. The value of D or X is applicable only to the individual OBX. All other OBX segments with the same Observation ID and observation sub-ID must have the same value. In the case of coding systems such as LOINC, the preceding rules typically mean that this field applies to a single OBX segment. There are situations where the observation battery required for the order needs to be dynamically specified at the time of ordering. That is, this battery is then defined by the set of OBX segments transmitted along with the order and generated by the placing system. For example, timed measurements of serum glucose challenge tests may vary among laboratories. One institution may report them at –30, -15, 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes, while another may report them at –30, 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. Master file entries may exist for each individual element of the battery but not for the battery itself. Another example may be Renin Studies where the specification may be done upon ordering without having a master file definition for each permutation of the possible element. The OBX segments in the ORM message can be used to create dynamic specifications to accommodate these permutations without defining pre-existing master file definitions for the battery itself. The result status field in the OBX can be used to indicate whether the OBX in the ORM message is used to provide a dynamic specification or is used to communicate a result as context to the order. The status of O shall be used to indicate that the OBX segment is used for a dynamic specification of the required result. An OBX used for a dynamic specification must contain the detailed examination code, units, etc., with OBX-11 valued with O, and OBX-2 and OBX-5 valued with null."}]}

Defined categories are listed in HL7 Table 0254 - Kind of Quantity in Chapter 2C, Code Tables. The distinctions of true quantities in this table are based primarily on dimensional analyses. The table contains a number of 'families,' those related to simple counts (number, number concentration, etc.), to mass (mass, mass concentration, etc.), to enzyme activity (catalytic content, catalytic concentration, etc.), and molar or equivalents (substance content, substance concentration).  By this classification, a glucose (in the US) would be classed as a mass concentration. A sodium would be classed as a substance concentration. Within the family, a total amount should be described as the unadorned variant; e.g., the property of measure for a patient's weight would be mass, not mass content. Most chemical measures produce concentrations, as exemplified by sodium and glucose. However, a 24-hour urine protein is not a mass concentration, but a mass rate (mass per unit time).
